Internal DSL written in Kotlin to read more-so like English rather than code. 
The objective of the DSL is to be able to schedule a meeting with details 
including meeting name, start and end times, date, and participants.

Program was written in Kotlin via IntelliJ IDEA IDE inside a
Gradle build environment. Files included are Main, Gradle
Build files, as well as a Test file which tests every single
line of the DSL to verify the expected output.
